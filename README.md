# Credit-Default-Prediction-and-Analysis
This project was undertaken to address a problem statement provided by a mid-sized bank aiming to predict loan defaulters and segment customers for targeted marketing. The primary objectives were to analyze customer demographics, transaction behavior, and account balances to derive actionable insights and build a predictive model to identify high-risk customers.

We utilized Python for data processing, analysis, and model training, delivering a comprehensive solution that integrates exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and strategic recommendations. Alongside the code, we prepared a detailed presentation summarizing our approach, findings, and insights.




A concise 5â€“10-minute presentation summarizing our methodology, findings, and recommendations.
Includes key visuals, graphs, and outcomes, making the analysis clear and actionable.
